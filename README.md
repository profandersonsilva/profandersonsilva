- 👋 Hi, I’m @profandersonsilva.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security, Information Security and Secure Development Lifecycle.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching about (i) homomorphic encryption applicable for IoT Smart Objects; and (ii) descentralized control systems for AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects mainly focused on IoT Security and AGV Open Control Systems (e.g. VDA5050).
- 📫 It´s easy to reach me at my e-mail box: anderson@inf.puc-rio.br
